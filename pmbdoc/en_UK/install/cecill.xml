    <title lang='en'>PREAMBLE</title>

    <para lang='en'>The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant
    users the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
    license within the framework of an open source distribution model. </para>

    <para lang='en'>The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain
    obligations for users so as to preserve this status for all subsequent
    redistributions. </para>

    <para lang='en'>In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to
    copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided
    only with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
    economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
    In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
    and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
    the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
    complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved for
    developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
    knowledge. </para>

    <para lang='en'>Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the Software's
    suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the
    security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally,
    to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement
    may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and
    that no provisions are either added or removed herefrom. </para>

    <para lang='en'>This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder
    of the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its
    provisions.</para>

    as to its commercial value, its secured, safe, innovative or relevant
    nature.</para>

    the Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
    relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore, the
    Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee arising out
    of any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in
    respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software.
    Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee,
    the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its
    defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided on a
    case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant
    to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any and all
    liability as regards the Licensee's use of the name of the Software. No
