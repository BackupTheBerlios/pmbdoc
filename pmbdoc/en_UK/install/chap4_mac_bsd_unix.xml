      <title>Using MAMP</title>

      <para>MAMP is an Apache 2, PHP, MySQL package available at <ulink
      url="???"><ulink url="???"><ulink
      url="???">www.mamp.info</ulink></ulink></ulink>.</para>

      <para>To install PMB on MAMP, unzip the PMB archive into
      Applications/MAMP/htdocs.</para>

      <para>When installing the database, specify :</para>

      <para>user mysql : root</para>

      <para>password : root</para>

      <para>server : 127.0.0.1:8889</para>

      <para>database : bibli</para>

      <para>For the rest, consult the general information on
      installation.</para>

      <para>Note : MAMP is distributed with the YAZ extension (z39.50) for Mac
      activated in PHP4. Cataloguing with z39.50 is immediately available for
      PMB users on MAMP, no further configuration needed.</para>

      <title>Using the Apache and PHP distribution supplied with Mac OS
      X</title>

      <para>Go to System Preferences, then Share, and activate Web sharing.
      The files found in /Library/Webserver/Documents correspond to files
      accessible by PMB : extract the PMB archive downloaded on www.sigb.net
      in this directory.</para>

      <para>MySQL is not supplied with Mac OS X. You will find a MySQL version
      at www.mysql.com.</para>

      <para>Once the PMB files have been extracted, you need to configure the
      PMB database. To do this, start your browser, Safari for example, and go
      to the address http://localhost/pmb/tables/install.php.</para>

      <para>PMB is accessible from now on at http://localhost/pmb.</para>

      url="???">http://www.sigb.net/mac</ulink> and install it in the PHP
      directory of your machine. In your <citetitle>php.ini</citetitle>, in
      the section extensions, add the line extension=yaz.so and restart your
      Apache server to activate it. To do this, go to System Preferences,
