  <title>The OPAC module</title>

  <para>OPAC stands for <emphasis role="bold">O</emphasis>nline <emphasis
  role="bold">P</emphasis>ublic <emphasis role="bold">A</emphasis>ccess
  <emphasis role="bold">C</emphasis>atalogue. The OPAC module allows readers
  to carry out a search in the library catalogue.</para>

  <para>In fact, the PMB OPAC module is a WebPAC : an OPAC accessible via the
  Web.</para>

  <para><emphasis>How to configure</emphasis> the OPAC is described in the
  <emphasis>PMB Administrator's Guide</emphasis>.</para>

  <para>The OPAC can be separate from the PMB management interface, and placed
  on a separate server. For more information about installing the OPAC consult
  the <emphasis>PMB Installation Guide</emphasis>.</para>

  <para><emphasis role="bold">Note</emphasis> this chapter isn't the OPAC
  help, but only a quick aide-memoire. A <emphasis>Guide to the PMB OPAC
  </emphasis>is currently in preparation.</para>

  <sect1 id="useropac_access">
    <title>Accessing the OPAC</title>

    <para>The OPAC catalogue of the PMB-managed library will be accessible by
    default at the following internet address :</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">[v1.3 to 2.1]</emphasis> <emphasis
    role="bold">http://localhost/pmb/opac_css</emphasis></para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">[v1.0 to 1.2]</emphasis>
    http://localhost/phpmybibli/opac_css</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">[pre-v1]</emphasis>
    http://localhost/phpmybibli/opac</para>

    <para>However, for the other workstations on a local network, you need to
    replace <emphasis>localhost</emphasis> by the network name of the PMB
    server.</para>

    <para>To obtain this name under Windows, right-click on <emphasis>My
    Computer</emphasis> then select <emphasis>Network ID</emphasis>. You will
    then be shown the name of the machine on the local network.</para>

    <para>The online catalogue produced by PMB is dynamic: It is automatically
    updated at each reload of the page. Therefore an update made in the
    management interface (see following sections) is reflected immediately. A
    newly catalogued item is also accessible immediately in the OPAC.</para>

    <title>Key word search</title>

    <para>If you enter a term in the "Search" textbox, the OPAC will display
    the results of your search. You can further refine your search by ticking
    or unticking the boxes which correspond to the elements which were queried
    : title, author, collection...</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">New</emphasis> : since version 1.3, the PMB

    searches you have undertaken.</para>

    <title>Browsing the categories</title>

    <para>Concieved to allow a facilitated exploration of the resources, the

    <title>Acces to the reader's account from the OPAC</title>

    <para>Readers registered in the management interface can access their
    account from the OPAC. That need for this their reader's bar code, which
    is found on their library card, as well as their password.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Note</emphasis> : by default this password is
    identical to the reader's bar code. It can be changed in the management
    interface, or at any time by the reader through accessing their account in
    the OPAC.</para>
