    <para lang="en">The OPAC catalogue of the PMB-managed library will be accessible by
    default at the following internet address :</para>

    <para lang="en"><emphasis role="bold">[v1.3 to 2.2]</emphasis> <emphasis
    role="bold">http://localhost/pmb/opac_css</emphasis></para>

    <para lang="en"><emphasis role="bold">[v1.0 to 1.2]</emphasis>

    <para lang="en"><emphasis role="bold">[pre-v1]</emphasis>
    http://localhost/phpmybibli/opac</para>

    <para lang="en">However, for the other workstations on a local network, you need to
    replace <emphasis>localhost</emphasis> by the network name of the PMB
    server.</para>

    <para lang="en">To obtain this name under Windows, right-click on <emphasis>My
    Computer</emphasis> then select <emphasis>Network ID</emphasis>. You will
    then be shown the name of the machine on the local network.</para>

    <para lang="en">The online catalogue produced by PMB is dynamic: It is automatically
    updated at each reload of the page. Therefore an update made in the
    management interface (see following sections) is reflected immediately. A
    newly catalogued item is also accessible immediately in the OPAC.</para>
