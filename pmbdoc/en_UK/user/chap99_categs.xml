      <title lang="en">The UNESCO Thesaurus</title>

      <para lang="en">The thesaurus, fairly large, is a multi-faceted
      thesaurus, suitable for libraries looking for a minute subject index, or
      social sciences research laboratories.</para>

      <title lang="en">Agneaux Media Library Thesaurus</title>

      <para lang="en">This thesaurus was introduced since the early beginnings
      of PMB. It is a contribution of François Lemarchand
      (http://balno.free.fr).</para>

      <para lang="en">This small thesaurus is not meant to remain fixed in its
      hierarchical structure, but rather to be a starting point towards the
      elaboration of a simple "home-thesaurus" adapted to one's
      requirements.</para>

      <para lang="en">A non copyrighted thesaurus, well adapted to

      <para lang="en">It is a good starting point towards the elaboration of

    <title lang="en">Decimal classifications installed with PMB</title>

    <para lang="en">Integrated in PMB is an authority file corresponding to a
    decimal classification. This classification can be the place where to
    store your Dewey classification, for instance.</para>

    <para lang="en">The Dewey classification is a decimal classification
    system, starting with ten main classes numbered from 0 to 9, each main
    class having ten divisions, and each division having ten sections, etc ...
    A classmark is represented by three digits at the base (example : 470).
    After the first three digits, a decimal point is used as the starting
    point towards minute sub-divisions.</para>

    <para lang="en">Dewey classications are often prefixed with the first
    three letters of an author's name to make up classmarks of books in public
    libraries.</para>

    <para lang="en">Other alpha-numeric classification systems exist with
    structures like the DDC, for instance, the Universal Decimal
    Classification (UDC).</para>

    <para lang="en">Just like for the choice of a subject index preloaded when
    installing PMB, it is necessary to make sure you choose a classification
    system adapted to it.</para>

      classification, available at <ulink
      url="http://www.bm-chambery.fr/institution/organisation/index.htm">site</ulink>
      on internet. It is a decimal system, based on the Dewey, with classmarks
      for music notably.</para>

      <para lang="en">Very well designed, this classification may however be
      too detailed for a small library.</para>

      secondary schools.</para>

      <para lang="en">It is a Dewey style classification using only the Dewey
      one hundred divisions table ranging from 000 to 990.</para>
